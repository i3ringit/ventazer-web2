# About Me

To all recruiters, welcome.

My name is Marcos del Cristo, I am a software developer residing in Champaign, Illinois. I'm available to hire immediately in the greater Chicago area.

## Preferences

**Environment:** I'm looking for an environment where a smart, motivated, and hard-working developer can grow and learn. I work very hard to make sure I’m not a burden on my team; constantly looking to improve, always receptive and responsive to criticism.

**Team:** I want to work with a professional team and write great software, including testing, debugging and profiling. My goal is to develop quality software that makes a difference. I want to work with like-minded individuals, a team excited to come to the office and make something great, together.

**Work/Life Balance:** I understand it’s up to me to become the best engineer I can be, so I spend the necessary time after work hours to push the boundaries of my technical abilities. I also understand there are times when extra work is required for time-sensitive deadlines, I’m more than happy to hunker down and get things done then. Having said that, working 80 hours a week all the time is not sustainable.

**Technical:** I love solving tough problems and can learn anything, so bring it on. If you need me to become an expert on Node.js, AWS, client-side performance, automated test strategies, web workers, or even 3rd party APIs, then I will.

**Language Preferences:**

* Interpreted languages, preferably Javascript; I’d love to improve my Node.js chops. Python is fine too. I’ve also worked with PHP for several projects in the past (VetMed Scheduler, WordPress).
* Compiled languages, preferably Java. Alternatively, C, C++, or Go. Although I have limited experience in these languages, I’d love to work on high-performance code.

## A little about me

* I’m eager to learn new things.
* I love solving programming problems.
* I am a self-learner, independent, and have outstanding problem-solving skills.
* I can multi-task in a fast paced, dynamic environment.
* I have excellent written and verbal communications skills (English and Spanish).
* I want to become a great engineer.
* I drive a 2001 Ford Mustang that I love (except when it snows).
* I’m really nice.
* I dress pretty well.
* I love to cook. I make the best meatballs ***I have*** ever tasted.
